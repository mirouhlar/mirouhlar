# PROJECTS

### Diploma Thesis

Date :	29.10.2021 - 22.04.2022

Short description	:

This project (Diploma Thesis) deals with modelling and optimal control of physical systems with emphasis on underactuated dynamical systems. The use of analytical identification methods is the main characteristic of the proposed methodology for modelling and simulation of dynamical system via the Lagrange formulation of mechanics. The presented methodology is implemented in Matlab using Symbolic Math Toolbox, enabling the generation of mathematical models for dynamical systems in the form of classic Matlab functions or Simulink blocks. Three case studies make use of the proposed methodology to obtain a platform of underactuated dynamic systems. Project (Diploma Thesis) also deals with the design and implementation of optimal control algorithms based on the quadratic criterion minimization, and with predictive control design based on the linear system model. Considered control algorithms are implemented in the Matlab as well as Simulink, in the form of custom blocks. Finally, project deals with design and implementation of an Matlab application presents the obtained results of modelling and control of underactuated systems.

### Mobile robot simulator

Date	:	10.10.2021 â€“ 10.12.2021

Short description	:

Mobile robot simulator is an application which allows user to create own map (CSV map), which can be updated in application and is used as an environment where mobile robot can move. App includes D* Lite algorithm for obstacle avoidance. 

Ordered / cooperated by	:	Technical University of KoÅ¡ice 

Position in team	:	Programmer, Analyst, Tester, Researcher

Processed work part in details	:	Mobile robot simulator is a new desktop application that represents the simulation of the movement of a mobile robot in an environment with obstacles. The application is based on a mathematical model of a mobile robot - a kinematic model (possibility of expanding it with a dynamic model). The position and orientation of the robot is ensured by the implementation of odometry. The movement is ensured by the use of a proportional regulator. The design of the controller was implemented using control theory. The ability of the mobile robot to avoid obstacles is ensured by the implementation of the D* lite algorithm. The simulator environment is programmed using Pygame (Python).

Completing the task required conducting a study of the issue, programming the application, solving problems, implementing control algorithms and obstacle avoidance algorithms. The entire application is the author's work (Miroslav UhÄ¾ar).

Operating system	:	Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Linux

Used languages, software, tools and technologies	:	Python, ROS2, numpy, pygame

### Information System

Date	:	15.04.2021 â€“ 25.05.2021

Short description	:

An information system is an app/system designed to collect, process, store and distribute information. It is an application for manufacturing sector. 

Ordered / cooperated by	:	Technical University of KoÅ¡ice 

Position in team	:	Programmer, Analyst, Tester, Researcher

Processed work part in details	:	The result is an information system for fictional company. The entire application is the work of the author (Miroslav UhÄ¾ar). The main task was to design the structure of the information system based on the assumptions and requirements of a fictitious company. The application is programmed in C# and considers the organizational structure of the company, the flow of material in the company, the distribution of services to individual job positions in the organizational structure. The information system works with a SQL relational database, the structure of which is designed by the author.
 

Operating system	:	Microsoft Windows, Mac OS

Used languages, software, tools and technologies	:	C#, Oracle SQL

### Sights recognition application

Date	:	23.09.2020 â€“ 10.02.2021

Short description	:
Sights is a mobile application designed for recognizing historical buildings in the city of KoÅ¡ice. The recognition of sights is ensured by taking its picture and subsequent use of artificial intelligence â€“ convolutional neural network.  

Ordered / cooperated by	:	Technical University of KoÅ¡ice / NXT Soft s.r.o.

Position in team	:	Programmer, Tester

Processed work part in details	:	Sights is a new application designed for mobile phones with the Android operating system. This application was created as a student project in cooperation with NXT Soft s.r.o. Five team members participated in the development of the application. During the development of the application, we met once a week, where we discussed the results achieved and planned the tasks for the next week. During the development of the application, it was necessary to obtain data (photographs) of sights, which were necessary for training an artificial neural network.
Partial tasks in which the author participated (Miroslav UhÄ¾ar):
- Creation and editing of the dataset
- Application creation
- Troubleshooting
- Neural network training
- Implementation of a neural network in the application 

The resulting application was presented at the "Team Projects 2020" event. The project was further expanded by the implementation of additional machine learning algorithms, in order to improve the solution.

Operating system	:	Microsoft Windows, Mac OS
Used languages, software, tools and technologies	:	Python, keras, tensorflow, tensorflow lite, numpy, Android studio, Java
